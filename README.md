### Executive Summary
Fires are among the most destructive events that demand rapid responses to minimize damage and save lives. While early fire detection is critical, understanding the severity of a fire is equally important to determine the appropriate emergency response. A minor fire demands a very different reaction compared to a large-scale, fast-spreading blaze. Most traditional fire detection models focus only on identifying whether fire is present, offering little insight into the urgency of the situation. This project addresses that gap by building a model that classifies fire images into three severity levels: small, medium, and large. By doing so, it aims to provide richer, more actionable information for firefighting and disaster response. Explainability methods, LIME and SHAP, are also included to make the modelâ€™s predictions more transparent. These techniques help verify which parts of the input images influenced the model's decisions, ensuring that the model focuses on meaningful visual features like flames and smoke rather than irrelevant background noise. In doing so, it advances traditional fire detection toward a more practical, reliable, and real-world deployable solution.
